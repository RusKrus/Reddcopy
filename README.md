# Welcome to Reddcopy app: your Minimalist Reddit Experience

## I'm iviting you to dive into the world of Reddit with Reddcopy, a streamlined web application designed to provide a clean and efficient way to browse content using four popular categories. Explore the main Reddit feed, delve into individual posts, and engage with comments, all within a minimalist and user-friendly interface.

## About the Project

This project was created as a pet project to learn and practice modern front-end development technologies, such as TypeScript, React, Redux, and integration with external APIs.

* **Infinite Scroll:** Enjoy a continuous stream of new posts without the need for manual loading.
* **Detailed Post View:** Explore posts in detail, including subreddit information and comments.
* **Bug Reporting:** Easily report any issues encountered to help improve the application (almost finished).

**Technologies Used**

* **React(CRA):** A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
* **Redux:** A state management library that ensures efficient data handling and component interaction.
* **React Router:** A library for seamless navigation and routing within the application.
* **UUID:** A library for generating unique identifiers.
* **Jest(RTL):** A testing framework for conducting comprehensive unit tests.
* **Cypress:** A tool for robust end-to-end testing.
* **Reddit API:** Used for searching posts and load data about them.
