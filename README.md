# Reddcopy
Hello! This is my first huge web app, i wanted to make a copy of reddit. I wanted to create a minimalist application that displays the main Reddit feed, with the ability to view each post and its comments separately. I spent a lot of time on this project, as most of the work involved refining details and fixing small errors (which, unfortunately, are not completely resolved).

## Technologies Used:
The main technologies are React, Redux, React-Router, and small libraries like UUID. For testing, I used Jest (unit tests) and Cypress (end-to-end tests). You can see more details about the libraries used in the package.json file.

## Features:
The user has a minimal yet sufficient set of tools:
- The ability to browse posts and change the category of loaded posts.
- Infinite scroll allows users to continuously receive new posts without extra effort.
- The option to view each post in more detail, along with its subreddit and comments.
- A search function on the main page, with functional buttons for navigation.
- Almost implemented feature to send a bug report to my email for fixing.

## Future Work:
- User authentication.
- The ability to send bug reports directly on the site.
- The ability to view posts from specific subreddit communities.
- The ability to view all comments on a post, with filtering options.
- Dark theme.
- Proper display of posts with voting.
- Make the application even more visually appealing.
